#### Common Tools
- Ncrack 
-  wfuzz
- medusa
- patator
- hydra

*Focussing on Hydra*
#### Basic HTTP Auth
1. http provides two parallel authentication mechanisms:
		Basic HTTP AUTH used to authenticate with HTTP Server
2. Proxy Server Authentication 
		Used to authenticate with the intermediate proxy server. 

Client sends reuqest without authentication, server responds with WWW-Authenticate header field.

Base64 used for transmission of data transmitted in response in the Authorization field.

| **Password Attack Type** |
| ------------------------ |
| `Dictionary attack`      |
| `Brute force`            |
| `Traffic interception`   |
| `Man In the Middle`      |
| `Key Logging`            |
| `Social engineering`     |

#### Brute Force 
for a password with a length of 4 we would start from aaaa -> zzzz
all English lowercase characters would yield half a million permutations.
this is big
#### Dictionary Attacks
use precompiled list of passwords to preform Brute Force attack (rockyou.txt... etc)
==Rockyou.txt is sorted by how common the passwords are ==


#### Methods of Brute Force Attacks 
|**Attack**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Online Brute Force Attack|Attacking a live application over the network, like HTTP, HTTPs, SSH, FTP, and others|
|Offline Brute Force Attack|Also known as Offline Password Cracking, where you attempt to crack a hash of an encrypted password.|
|Reverse Brute Force Attack|Also known as username brute-forcing, where you try a single common password with a list of usernames on a certain service.|
|Hybrid Brute Force Attack|Attacking a user by creating a customized password wordlist, built using known intelligence about the user or the service.|

## Default Passwords
Default passwords used for testing purposes. Could be forgotten to change. 
==__Seclists== has a list of default credentials__
Seclists default login credentials can contain both user and passwords. 
use  `-C` in hydra to specify combined credentials list

###### Hydra Requires 3 pieces of info creds, host, path
Can specify individual username(-L) and password files (-P)


## Modules

##### HTTP-post-form
allows hydra to post form data
requires 3 strings separated by :  
"/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:incorrect"
Username:Password:string so hydra recognises failed attempt

## Determine Login Parameters
*Protip you can use get post data from chrome/firefox on developer console*

with -ri command it is possible to use regex to filter wordlists

```bash
sed -ri '/^.{,7}$/d' william.txt            # remove shorter than 8
sed -ri '/[!-/:-@\[-`\{-~]+/!d' william.txt # remove no special chars
sed -ri '/[0-9]+/!d' william.txt            # remove no numbers
```

#### Mangling
Possible to mange wordlists with [The Mentalist](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist.git)
Mangling  takes wordlist and makes a lot of possible permutations of it. 

#### Custom Username Wordlist
Certain tools take data and create custom username lists 
one such tool is [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy)

## Service Authentication Brute Forcing
#### SSH Attack
The command used to attack a login service is fairly straightforward. We simply have to provide the username/password wordlists, and add `service://SERVER_IP:PORT`
