Cross Site Scripting
Usually medium risk as low impact. Generally only affect user executing the vulnerability. 

Limited to browser's JS engine, therefore cannot execute system-wide JavaScript code for System Level Code Execution.

#### Three types of XSS
|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`Stored (Persistent) XSS`|The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)|
|`Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS`|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)|
|`DOM-based XSS`|Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)|

Two types of Reflected XSS Dom based and Reflected.
Reflected gets processes on back end through http requests
Dom Based is processed on client side only through javascript changing dom models
#### Sink & Source
- Source is object that takes user input 
- Sinnk is function that writes user input to DOIM
	###### Popular Methods
	- document.write()
	- DOM.innerHTML
	- DOM.outerHTML
- __Jquery__
		Add()
		After()
		Append()


Sink functions do not allow script tags within them so there are other ways

```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
