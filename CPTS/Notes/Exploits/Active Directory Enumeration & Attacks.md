## Introduction
At the time of writing this module, Microsoft Active Directory holds around `43%` of the [market share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/identity-and-access-management/microsoft-active-directory-market-share#faqs) for enterprise organizations utilizing `Identity and Access management` solutions.
We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames

Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:
- Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
- This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
- Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

Kerbrute is good.
