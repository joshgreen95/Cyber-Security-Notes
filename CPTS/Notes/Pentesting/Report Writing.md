## Types of Assessments
#### Vulnerability Assessment 
Running a scan to enumerate vulnerabilities on an environment. Can be authenticated or unauthenticated. 
No exploitation is attempted but we look to validate scanners findings so our report can show which are real issues and which are false positives. 

#### Internal Vs. External 
External tests take on the perspective of an anonymous user on the internet targeting the organizations public systems. Internal tests are preformed as an internal user behind the firewall.

*Black-Box*: We have no information about the company or systems.
*Grey-Box*: We are given the scope ip addresses
*White-Box*: We are given credentials, source-code and information/configuration.

Evasion
*Zero Evasion*, *Hybrid-Evasion*, *Evasive testing* Determinant on if we are trying to hide from an admin.
#### Inter-Disciplinary 
##### Purple-Team 
Combined effort between Blue and Red team. Pen-tester simulates a threat and blue team simulated response to this to review their existing tool-set and security policies.
##### Cloud-Focused
Penetration test with a background on cloud architecture and administration to help articulate security repercussions.
##### Comprehensive IOT Testing
IOT platforms have 3 major components; Network, Cloud, Application.
Specialists will be able to provide a much more thorough assessment than just relying on one person.
##### Web-App Pen testing
Testing of application and infrastructure of a web-app.

##### Hardware Pen testing
Pen-testing physical hardware of iot devices. 

### Draft Report
Commonplace for clients to have conversation and dialogue and incorporate their feedback into the report: 
- Add comments to report to management how things will be fixed.
- Tweak potentially inflammatory language

Best to plan on a time when submitting a report where it can be reviewed by client.

### Final Report
After reviewing draft and confirming they are satisfied with it.

### Post Remediation Report
Retesting previously found and remediated vulnerabilities. Shouldn't be redoing entire assessment but focusing only on findings from first assessment. 

### Attestation Report
Some clients will request an `Attestation Letter` or `Attestation Report` that is suitable for their vendors or customers who require evidence that they've had a penetration test done.

### Tips/tricks
Send start notification email.
- Tester name
- Description of the type/scope of the engagement
- Source IP address for testing (public IP for an external attack host or the internal IP of our attack host if we are performing an Internal Penetration Test)
- Dates anticipate for testing
- Primary and secondary contact information (email and phone)
`The report is your highlight reel and is honestly what the client is paying for!`
