### Vulnerability Assessment
A vulnerability assessment is based on various security standards and makes sure a company is compliant in this (*Going through a checklist*).

### Penetration Testing
Simulated threat actor preforms penetration test to check which exploits are possible and patch them.

As with a vulnerability assessment, an effective pentest will result in a detailed report full of information that can be used to improve a network's security. All kinds of pentests can be performed according to an organization's specific needs.

*Black Box* - No information given about systems.
*Grey Box* - Some information given. Equivalent to an employee.
*White Box* - Source Code and all information given.

*Application* - assess web-apps and apis
*Network/Infrastructure* - Network/Routers/Firewalls
*Physical* - Break in.

### Vulnerability Assessment Vs. Pentesting
*Vulnerability Assessments* look for vulnerabilities in the network without simulated attacks.
A variety of standards should be followed; `GDPR` `OWASP` 
A vulnerability assessment goes through a checklist.
- Do we meet this standard?
- Do we have this configuration?

*Penetration Tests* are simulated cyber attacks to see how a network can be penetrated.
Generally cost more but compliment each other nicely.

### Other Types of Security Audit
#### Security Audits
Typically requirements from outside the industry, usually government agencies or industry associations. 

`PCI-DSS` - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, ran by credit card industry. A company that accepts credit cards must pass a security audit before they can take payment.

#### Bug Bounties
*Bug Bounty Programs* pay hundreds - thousands of dollars to find security vulnerabilities in their average programs.

#### Red Team Assessment
Larger companies can hire their own dedicated red teams or use services of third-party consulting firms to simulate black box tests.

#### Purple Team Assessment 
Red and Blue team working together to improve security of their network.

## Vulnerability Assessment
A `Vulnerabiliity Assessment` aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment.

### Methodology
![[NetworkVulnerabilityAssessment.png]]
- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat


## CVSS
*Common Vulnerability Scoring System* 5 factors
- Damage Potential
- Reproducibility
- Exploitability
- Affected Users
- Discoverability

`Confidentiality Impact` relates to securing information and ensuring only authorized individuals have access. For example, a high severity value would be in the case of an attacker stealing passwords or encryption keys. A low severity value would relate to an attacker taking information that may not be a vital asset to an organization.

`Integrity Impact` relates to information not being changed or tampered with to maintain accuracy. For example, a high severity would be if an attacker modified crucial business files in an organization's environment. A low severity value would be if an attacker could not specifically control the number of changed or modified files.

`Availability Impact` relates to having information readily attainable for business requirements. For example, a high value would be if an attacker caused an environment to be completely unavailable for business. A low value would be if an attacker could not entirely deny access to business assets and users could still access some organization assets.
